    <h1>Mapping Adereon: A Fantasy Cartography Project</h1>

      <!-- First column, the left half -->
      <div class="first-column">
        <p>LOCALES ACROSS North America are experiencing what seems to be a <b>revolution in
          craft beer</b>. To date, there are over 7,000 scattered across the continent,
          including Hawaii.
        <br><p>EVEN COMPANIES who don't make beer have been caught up in this transnational
          brew-craze. <b>Aztec Aquaponics</b>, a small company based out of Albuquerque,
          specializes in using beer brewing byproducts for their aquaponic operations.
          Their produce, sustainable fish and lettuce greens, supply an artisan fast-casual
          national restaurant chain.
        <br><p>THE ABOVE MAP was commissioned for Aztec in order to assist with their current
          site-selection for a new location.
          In addition to locating a <b>high-density area of breweries</b> to maximize their
          aquaponic production,
          their supply chain requires that they <b>cannot transport the brewery byproducts
          more than 25 km</b>.
        <br><p>WHERE should they locate? <b>Hex binning</b> brewery locations in North
          America and Hawaii offers a potential answer.
          Hex binning is a technique of spatial analysis that involves creating an array of
          equally-sized hexagons that measure the density of a phenomena.
          While I hope that this analysis benefits Aztec, it might also be of use to discerning
          beer drinkers and craft enthusiasists across the continent
          as they decide where they might settle down.
        <br><p>ALL TOLD – and setting aside the bursting of any craft beer bubbles, so to speak – Aztec
          is in a good position to select a new location.
          <b>Coastal regions appear the most promising</b> when it comes to craft beer proximity.
          The greater Seattle, San Francisco, and San Diego regions would be successful on the
          Pacific Coast, while Boston, Washington DC, and Jersey City all share a high alcohol
          content on the eastern seaboard.
          Looking in between, Denver, Chicago, and St. Louis also prove likely candidates.
          However, more granular analysis is necessary to determine anything past these
          preliminary suggestions.
        <br><br><br><br><p><i>A GeoJSON file of the hex grid, which includes a field for total breweries
          in each hexagon, can be found <a href="../geojson/brew_hex.geojson" target=blank>here</a>.</i></p>
